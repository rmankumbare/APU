//---------------------------------Version H2.8--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//---------------------------------Version H2.7--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5th May : 1. DC CONTACTER should be turned off only when APU Engine stops successfully.
             In prev version Once engine stop command received DC Contacter was turning OFF.
 
//---------------------------------Version H2.6--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5th May : 1. In APU engine ON condition DC contacter logic changed 
             DC contacter will turn on without any condition. Once Engine is ON contacter should remain ON.
             DC contacter should be OFF when rectifier current overloads i.e. it exceeds 114 amp.
             DC contacter should be OFF when rectifier voltage(APU voltage 72 V) exceeds 84 V.
          
//---------------------------------Version H2.5---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28th April: 1. Fuel transfer pump will be on-off in engine on & off both conditions whether it is auto or manual mode.
               It will sense the values & take decesion according to that.  

//---------------------------------Version H2.3---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24th April: 1. IN GUI healthyness status all parameters are used to send eng healthiness status.
            2. In fail to stop mode, if emergency stop pressed then it will break the infinite loop & come out of loop. 
            3. In engine off condition FTP ON-OFF commands are modified as per sibas mode flag.
//---------------------------------Version H2.2----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22nd April: 1.Rectifier temperature sensing is added. It is similar to Eng coolant temp. RTD sensor. It is a nonlinear type having look up table.
              channel name       =  Canopy temp
              adc no             =  ADC 3 
              terminal no        =  19
              Port pin           =  PB1   

21st April: 1. Code optimization done.

//---------------------------------Version H2.1----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
20th April: 1. GUI mistake removed.
               In download command APU batt 12 V warnings removed as per GUI protocol, but in Master program those were present .
               After removing them everything is fine.

19th April: 

             1.If ethernet initilised display will send 'Z' that means APU is in SIBAS mode. So FTP, Load/unload should occure according to SIBAS not according to value read from EEPROM  

             2. In LCU discrete byte 1 following commands added
                FTP ON/OFF
                COMP LOAD/UNLOAD
                EMERGENCY STOP

             3. Initially when ethernet initilised then display sends command 'Z' to master indicates that APU is in SIBAS mode
  
             4. FTP on-off flag , loco_emergency_stop_flag added in frame.
